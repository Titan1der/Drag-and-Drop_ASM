# Drag-and-Drop_ASM
University Add-on Project:
Drag and drop words on MS-DOS using Assembly Language only

## What I learned:
The project helped me understand the inner workings of a computer and made me appreciate more how programming has evolved.
Even though it's unlikely that the next customer application will be developed in assembly, 
it can be used to analyze abstracted code and figure out ways to fix or improve code performance from a different perspective.
